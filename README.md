# Aether

**AI co-debugging for Unity.** Stop narrating your gameplay—your AI can see the game.

Aether bridges your Unity game to Cursor, giving the AI complete context: live state, event history, crashes, and GTML snapshots. Two modes: **Live Inspector** (real-time object inspection) and **Replay Mode** (time-travel debugging after a bug).

---

## Install

```bash
/add-plugin aether
```

That's it. The bridge auto-downloads on first use.

**First time in a Unity project?** Run this once from your project root:

```bash
npx aether-init
```

Then reload Cursor (Ctrl+Shift+P → Reload Window), enter Play mode, and ask your AI: *"What's the state of my game?"*

---

## Requirements

Unity 2021.3+, Node.js 18+, Cursor with MCP

---

## When the Agent Uses Aether

The plugin includes a skill that guides the agent to use Aether when:

- Debugging Unity gameplay behavior
- Analyzing crashes, NullReferenceExceptions, or runtime errors
- Inspecting object state during Play Mode
- Asking "what happened before this crash?" or "why is this object behaving wrong?"
